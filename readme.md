This is free software under LGPL 2.1 or -- at your option -- any later version. See [docs/copying.md](docs/copying.md)

Read [docs/intro.md](docs/intro.md) and [docs/soapbox.md](docs/soapbox.md) for why I wrote this thing and what my goals are. 

See ``online_example.py`` and [docs/getting\_started.md](docs/getting_started.md) for what little there is in way of documentation. 

See [docs/lambda.md](docs/lambda.md) for specific issues with lambda expressions in python.
